$PRODUCES umask.c

$BUILTIN umask
$FUNCTION umask_builtin
$SHORT_DOC umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
Display or set file mode mask.

Sets the user file-creation mask to MODE.  If MODE is omitted, prints
the current value of the mask.

If MODE begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;
otherwise it is a symbolic mode string like that accepted by chmod(1).

Options:
  -p	if MODE is omitted, output in a form that may be reused as input
  -S	makes the output symbolic; otherwise an octal number is output

Exit Status:
Returns success unless MODE is invalid or an invalid option is given.
