$PRODUCES caller.c

$BUILTIN caller
$FUNCTION caller_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON DEBUGGER
$SHORT_DOC caller [expr]
Return the context of the current subroutine call.

Without EXPR, returns "$line $filename".  With EXPR, returns
"$line $subroutine $filename"; this extra information can be used to
provide a stack trace.

The value of EXPR indicates how many call frames to go back before the
current one; the top frame is frame 0.

Exit Status:
Returns 0 unless the shell is not executing a shell function or EXPR
is invalid.
